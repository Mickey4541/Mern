# File and Folder Differences:
- File is such place where we can store single type of data. like mp3, mp4, html, css, js.

- Folder is such place where we store various type of data. It is collection of file where we can maintain files.

- Div is used to make a layout in websites.

> IMPORTANT:
- we can use <div id="main">Main code here..</main>. But instead of this. we can use <nav></nav>, <header></header>,<main></main>, <aside></aside>,<footer></footer> to enhance the SEO of our site.
